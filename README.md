# cypress-basico-v2

Sample project for the basic course of the Talking About Testing - Cypress Basic v2.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v20.12.1`, `10.5.0` and `13.7.2` of Node.js, npm and Cypress, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

You can run the tests simulating desktop or mobile viewport.

### Desktop

Run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode on a desktop viewport.
Or, run `npm run cy:test`  to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

### Mobile

Run `npm run cy:open:mobile` to open Cypress in interactive mode on a mobile viewport.
Or, run `npm run cy:test:mobile`  to run the test in headless mode on a mobile viewport.
